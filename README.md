# Employee Tracker CMS

  ## Description
   This is a simple command line application utilizing mySQL that allows the user to easily manage a database of employees, roles, and departments. The application walks the user through each  action to extract the necassary data to create the appropriate query. The results of the user action are then stored to the database and data validating the change is posted to the terminal.
   
   Through this challenge, I further developed skills in the following technologies:
    - SQL / mySQL
    - Creating SQL queries to perform CRUD actions on a database
    - Prepared statements to query based on user input
    - Utilizing mySQL within a Node.js framework
    - async await syntax for asyncronous operations
